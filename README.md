# TigerIsland

The game has all rules implemented. The game is fully playable and runs without error.
The only limitations are from the AI.
The AI doesn't expand settlements, and does not place tiger playgrounds. Also when it plays itself they will stop the progression of one another and eventually end up losing because they are out of Villagers. The AI will place totoros if it can build a settlement of size 5.
