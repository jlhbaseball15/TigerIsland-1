# TigerIsland

The game has all rules implemented. The game is fully playable and runs without error.
The only limitations are from the game.AI.
The game.AI doesn't expand settlements, and does not place tiger playgrounds. Also when it plays itself they will stop the progression of one another and eventually end up losing because they are out of Villagers. This issue does not normally occur against other game.AI, and our game.AI will place totoros if it can build a settlement of size 5.
